With this TCP reverse shell we read attackers IP from first cmd line parameter you supply when you run the program. Then create new client socket. AF_INET parameter tells socket library to make it TCP socket. After the socket is created, we can use it to connect the socket on the machine by supplying a tuple containing the socket's IP and Port. Client should then notify attacking machine it's ready to accept commands.
